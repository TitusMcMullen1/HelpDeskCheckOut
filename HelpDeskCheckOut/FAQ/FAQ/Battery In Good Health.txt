You’ve probably heard some people say you should drain your battery completely before 
charging it, or that you should keep it between 40% and 80% all the time to make it 
last longer. Most of these rules are outdated, applying to older nickel-based batteries. 
Luckily, most or all of your gadgets these days run on Lithium Ion batteries, which are 
easy to take care of. We recommend reading our full guide on how they work, but the gist 
is: they last longer when you perform shallow discharges, keep them cool, and don’t leave 
them plugged in while they’re running at 100%. Honestly, though, batteries have a finite 
life no matter what, and your efforts will only go so far—so don’t stress about it. Focus 
your efforts on getting better battery life out of your iPhone, Android phone, or laptop 
on a given charge instead—and knowing how to replace the battery when it starts dying.
